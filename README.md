## Hydra-ROS

This repository contains the ROS interface for [Hydra](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Hydra) and is based on the following papers:
  - ["Hydra: A Real-time Spatial Perception System for 3D Scene Graph Construction and Optimization"](http://www.roboticsproceedings.org/rss18/p050.pdf)
  - ["Foundations of Spatial Perception for Robotics: Hierarchical Representations and Real-time Systems"](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02783649241229725)

### Getting started

> :warning: **Warning** <br>
> The ROS2 version of this package is in active development and is not guaranteed to build, run or have documentation. You have been warned!

Hydra has been tested on Ubuntu 22.04 and ROS2 Iron. See [here](doc/ros2_setup.md) to get started with Hydra and ROS2. See [here](docker/README.md) for using Hydra with ROS2 in Docker.

### Running Hydra

See our documentation [here](doc/quickstart.md).

### Design Information

We maintain information on the ROS2 interfaces that Hydra uses [here](doc/hydra_ros_interfaces.md) that may be useful if you are trying to understand how to use Hydra with a new dataset.

### Filing Issues

:warning: We don't support other platforms. Issues requesting support on other platforms (e.g. Ubuntu 16.04, Windows) will be summarily closed.

Depending on the nature of the issue, it may be helpful to browse [this](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Hydra/blob/main/doc/debugging.md) page about debugging Hydra first.
